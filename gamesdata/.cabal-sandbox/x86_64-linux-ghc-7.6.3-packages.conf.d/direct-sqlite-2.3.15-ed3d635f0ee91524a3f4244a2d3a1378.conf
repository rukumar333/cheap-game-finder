synopsis: Low-level binding to SQLite3.  Includes UTF8 and BLOB support.
description: This package is not very different from the other SQLite3 bindings out
             there, but it fixes a few deficiencies I was finding.  As compared to
             bindings-sqlite3, it is slightly higher-level, in that it supports
             marshalling of data values to and from the database.  In particular, it
             supports strings encoded as UTF8, and BLOBs represented as ByteStrings.
